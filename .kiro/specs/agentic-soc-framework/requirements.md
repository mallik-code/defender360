# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Agentic AI Architecture for SOC Operations - a next-generation cybersecurity framework designed for enterprise-scale SOCs that leverages multiple specialized AI agents to automate threat detection, analysis, and response. The system will transform traditional SOC operations by providing intelligent, autonomous agents that can process security events, correlate threats, prioritize alerts, and execute response actions with minimal human intervention while maintaining full auditability and compliance. The solution is optimized for large organizations with 1000+ employees, complex IT infrastructure, and dedicated security teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Threat Detection System

**User Story:** As a SOC analyst, I want an intelligent multi-agent system that can automatically detect, analyze, and correlate security threats across multiple data sources, so that I can focus on high-priority incidents and strategic security improvements rather than manual log analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security logs are ingested THEN the Log Ingestion Agent SHALL parse and normalize data from at least 8 different security tool formats (SIEM, EDR, NDR, email security, cloud security, identity management, vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence platforms)
2. WHEN normalized logs are processed THEN the Anomaly Detection Agent SHALL identify behavioral anomalies using machine learning models with at least 95% accuracy and less than 2% false positive rate
3. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the Threat Intelligence Agent SHALL correlate findings with external threat intelligence feeds within 30 seconds
4. WHEN threat correlation is complete THEN the Alert Prioritization Agent SHALL assign risk scores (1-10) based on asset criticality, threat severity, business context, and compliance requirements
5. IF an alert scores 8 or higher THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate to human analysts within 60 seconds

### Requirement 2: Automated Response and Orchestration

**User Story:** As a SOC manager, I want automated response capabilities that can execute containment actions and SOAR playbooks based on threat analysis, so that we can reduce mean time to response and minimize security incident impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-priority alerts are generated THEN the Response Automation Agent SHALL execute appropriate SOAR playbooks within 2 minutes
2. WHEN containment actions are required THEN the system SHALL isolate affected endpoints, block malicious IPs, quarantine suspicious files, and disable compromised accounts automatically
3. WHEN automated responses are executed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed audit logs with full traceability of all actions taken and compliance reporting
4. IF automated response fails THEN the system SHALL immediately escalate to human operators with failure details and recommended manual actions within 30 seconds
5. WHEN incidents are resolved THEN the Learning Agent SHALL update detection models and playbooks based on incident outcomes within 4 hours

### Requirement 3: Security and Compliance Framework

**User Story:** As a CISO, I want robust security controls and compliance capabilities built into the agent framework, so that we can maintain regulatory compliance while ensuring the AI agents themselves don't introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents communicate THEN all inter-agent communication SHALL be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher
2. WHEN agents access data THEN role-based access control (RBAC) SHALL enforce least-privilege principles for each agent type
3. WHEN agent actions are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain immutable audit logs compliant with GDPR, NIST, and SOX requirements
4. WHEN agent outputs are generated THEN validation mechanisms SHALL verify output integrity and detect potential AI model poisoning
5. IF compliance violations are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate compliance reports and alert designated personnel

### Requirement 4: Scalable Architecture and Performance

**User Story:** As a SOC architect, I want a scalable, high-performance agent framework that can handle enterprise-scale security data volumes, so that the system can grow with our organization and maintain sub-minute response times even under heavy load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing security events THEN the system SHALL handle at least 500,000 events per minute with linear scalability up to 2 million events per minute
2. WHEN agent workloads increase THEN the system SHALL automatically scale agent instances based on queue depth and processing time with sub-second scaling decisions
3. WHEN agents become unavailable THEN failover mechanisms SHALL redirect workloads to healthy agents within 15 seconds with zero data loss
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN load balancing SHALL distribute work optimally across available agent instances with predictive scaling
5. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with full capabilities through redundant agent deployment and automatic failover

### Requirement 5: Integration and Interoperability

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want seamless integration with existing security tools and infrastructure, so that we can leverage our current investments while adding AI-powered capabilities without disrupting operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing tools THEN the system SHALL support REST APIs, GraphQL, webhooks, message queues, and standard security protocols (STIX/TAXII, CEF, LEEF, OpenIOC)
2. WHEN connecting to SIEM platforms THEN the system SHALL integrate with Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar, Chronicle, and other enterprise SIEM platforms without custom development
3. WHEN processing threat intelligence THEN the system SHALL consume feeds from commercial providers, government sources, industry sharing groups, and internal threat intelligence platforms
4. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL support cloud-native deployment (Kubernetes), on-premises deployment, and hybrid cloud architectures with multi-region capabilities
5. IF legacy systems lack APIs THEN the system SHALL provide database connectors, file-based integration, message queue integration, and custom adapter frameworks

### Requirement 6: Human-AI Collaboration Interface

**User Story:** As a SOC analyst, I want intuitive interfaces for collaborating with AI agents, reviewing their decisions, and providing feedback, so that I can maintain oversight while benefiting from AI automation and continuously improve system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL provide explainable AI outputs showing reasoning and confidence levels
2. WHEN analysts review alerts THEN the interface SHALL display agent analysis, recommended actions, and supporting evidence in a unified dashboard
3. WHEN analysts provide feedback THEN the system SHALL incorporate human corrections into agent learning processes within 24 hours
4. WHEN incidents occur THEN the Human Collaboration Agent SHALL generate executive summaries and technical reports automatically
5. IF agents require human input THEN the system SHALL present clear questions with sufficient context for informed decision-making

### Requirement 7: Continuous Learning and Adaptation

**User Story:** As a threat hunter, I want the AI agents to continuously learn from new threats, analyst feedback, and incident outcomes, so that the system becomes more effective over time and adapts to evolving threat landscapes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new threat patterns are identified THEN the Learning Agent SHALL update detection models within 4 hours
2. WHEN false positives are reported THEN the system SHALL adjust detection thresholds to reduce similar false positives by 50% within one week
3. WHEN new attack techniques are observed THEN the system SHALL automatically create new detection rules and update playbooks
4. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN all relevant agents SHALL receive updated indicators within 15 minutes
5. IF model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain models using recent data and validate improvements before deployment
